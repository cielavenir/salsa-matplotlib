matplotlib (0.98.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  With this release, we are setting the default backend for matplotlib to
  'TkAgg', the lower level of backend suggested by upsteam.

  You can find documentation about changing the backend in the file:

    /usr/share/doc/python-matplotlib/README.Debian

  Another change introduced is the removal of 'dvipng' from automatical
  installation. The net result is a reduction on the number (and then size) of
  packages to download and install to have matplotlib working, since 'dvipng'
  takes in 'texlive' (the LaTeX distribution); matplotlib has already a way to
  render mathmatical symbols, but if you want to use the tex render, then run

    apt-get install dvipng

  to reproduce the previous behaviour.
