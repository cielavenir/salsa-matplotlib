Description: python based plotting system in a style similar to Matlab
 Matplotlib is a pure python plotting library designed to bring publication 
 quality plotting to python with a syntax familiar to Matlab users. Although 
 the goal of publication quality is not yet attained, the library does produce 
 high quality 2D plots. All of the plotting commands in the pylab interface
 can be accessed either via a functional interface familiar to Matlab users or
 an object oriented interface familiar to python users.
